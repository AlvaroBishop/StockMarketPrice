# S&P 500 Price Prediction with Multiple Linear Regression
This project focuses on creating a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict the price of the S&P 500 stock index based on interest rates and employment numbers. Please note that the data set used in this project is entirely dummy data, designed for practice purposes only.

## Project Overview
The S&P 500 stock index is a significant indicator of the performance of the U.S. stock market. This project aims to explore how interest rates and employment numbers influence the daily closing value of the S&P 500 index. Understanding this relationship can be valuable for investors, financial analysts, and policymakers in making informed decisions.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is synthetic and is meant for educational and practice purposes. It does not represent real-world financial data but serves as a practical exercise for building and evaluating a multiple linear regression model.

The dataset contains the following variables:

 - S&P 500 Price: The daily closing value of the S&P 500 stock index.
 -  Interest Rates: The prevailing interest rates on the same date.
 -  Employment: Employment statistics on the same date.

The project aims to predict the S&P 500 Price using Interest Rates and Employment Numbers as independent variables.

## Model Evaluation
The project evaluates the performance of the Multiple Linear Regression model using standard regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) values. These metrics will help you assess the accuracy and goodness-of-fit of the model.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a practical exercise to understand how Multiple Linear Regression can be used to predict the S&P 500 price based on interest rates and employment numbers. Please remember that the dataset used here is for educational purposes only and does not reflect real financial data.
